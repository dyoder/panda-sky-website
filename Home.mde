Panda Sky allows you to publish APIs
much the way you can publish static Web sites
to S3 and CloudFront.
Your API will run with the same
availability, security, and scalability
as Amazon Web Services itself!

And all you have to do is:

- Define resources and methods in YAML

- Define handlers in JavaScript

- And publish with the `mango publish` command!
